Hi, I’m @austinalex1995

I’m interested in learning, programming, sports and finding solutions to tough problems.

I’m currently building my portfolio in React because it is the next stage of Mobile Development.
I got my degree in Mobile Development at Full Sail University in 2016 and I am transitioning
from building with Native Android (Java) and iOS (Swift) to React.

I’m looking to work with a company to build something together.
