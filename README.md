Hi, I’m @austinalex1995

I’m interested in learning, programming, sports and finding solutions to tough problems.

I’m currently building my portfolio to showcase different tools that I have learned and give examples of my work.
I got my degree in Mobile Development at Full Sail University in 2016 and I have experience in a ton of programming
languages such as: Java, Swift, React, React Native, Python, JavaScript and C#.

I’m looking to work with a company to build something together.
